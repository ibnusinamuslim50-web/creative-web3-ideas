# creative-web3-ideas
A collection of my personal thoughts and concepts about future technology, AI, and Web3.

## Example Concept
**Brainwave Key Security**  
An idea to use brainwave patterns as private key signatures for secure identity verification â€” to prepare for possible human-AI or body transfer technologies in the future.

## Philosophy
Even with limited resources, vision and creativity can turn any idea into something real.
